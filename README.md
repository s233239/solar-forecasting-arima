# Solar Forecasting ARIMA

**Forecasting monthly solar PV generation using ARMA and seasonal ARIMA models, including simulation of seasonal processes and autocorrelation structure analysis.**

This project explores how autoregressive models capture both short-term dependencies and seasonal patterns in renewable energy generation. Through analytical and simulation tasks, it studies model stability, stationarity, and prediction performance for solar power data.

## üìò Project Overview

The repository contains the work for *Assignment 2: ARMA Processes and Seasonal Processes*, completed as part of a time series analysis course.  
It includes theoretical exercises on AR(2) models, seasonal model simulations, and practical forecasting of solar power generation.
